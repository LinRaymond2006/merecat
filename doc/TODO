- Add 'server' section to config file,

  server title {
       host = virual-host.name
       port = PORT
       ssl  = BOOL
       redirect = site.tla:port
  }

- Let 'server' directives slowly replace vhost matching

  When virtual-host=false we can use either the title of the server
  directive or a separate host/server-name setting for matching the
  incoming requests.

- Add 'location' section to config file

  This to be able to set max-age per PATTERN rather than for all files,
  which may otherwise mess up reloading, e.g. a blog.

  location "PATTERN" {
       max-age = 2d
       add-header {
           key   = "Cache-Control"
  	 value = "public, no-transform"
       }
       gzip = true
  }

- Add proxy-pass to location directive

- Let command line options override port/host etc. that
  are in the global section of the config file.

- Verify cert at startup, abort if cert is too old or new
  add command line option to override (embedded systems)

Look into compressing CGI and ls() output using fmemopen()

IPv6 not working right.

Problem with ACME News downloads.  PATH_INFO interferes with the authorization.

Why is the client's IP address showing up in paths?

Fetches with numeric IP addresses and no Host: header are screwing up the
vhost code?

Add comment on INDEX_NAMES that it should be simple filenames only.

The error page generated for non-local referers should include the
original URL as an active link.

Make open in mmc.c use O_NONBLOCK flag, to prevent DOS attack via

Document how symlinks interact with .htpasswd - authorization is checked
on the result of the symlink, and not the origin.

Change redirect to put the Refresh command in the HTTP headers, instead of
a META tag.

Add TCP_NODELAY, but after CGIs get spawned.

Add stat cache?  1 minute expiry?

Ifdef the un-close-on-exec CGI thing for Linux only.

Add keep-alives, via a new state in thttpd.c.

The special world-permissions checking is probably bogus.  For one
thing, it doesn't handle restrictive permissions on parent directories
properly.  It should probably just go away.

redirect should interpret a path with a trailing / as /index.html

ssi should change $cwd to the source document's location.

Allow .throttle files in individual directories.

Log-digesting scripts.

Config web page.
    Common errors:
	Not realizing that -c overrides CGI_PATTERN instead of augmenting it.
	Using a directory name for the -c pattern.
