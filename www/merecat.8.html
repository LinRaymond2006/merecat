<code class="Nm" title="Nm">merecat</code> started out as a pun at Mongoose,
  which is another great web server, but is now useful for actual web serving
  purposes. It is however not a real Meerkat, merely yet another copycat, forked
  from the great <code class="Nm" title="Nm">thttpd</code> created by Jef
  Poskanzer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The limited feature set makes Merecat very quick:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<ul class="Bl-dash Bd-indent Bl-compac">
  <li>Virtual hosts</li>
  <li>URL-traffic-based throttling</li>
  <li>CGI/1.1</li>
  <li>HTTP/1.1 Keep-alive</li>
  <li>Built-in gzip deflate using zlib</li>
  <li>HTTPS support using OpenSSL/LibreSSL</li>
  <li>Dual server support, both HTTP/HTTPS from one process</li>
  <li>HTTP redirect support, per server. E.g., possible to redirect from HTTP to
      HTTPS. Limited set of Nginx style environment variables supported.</li>
  <li>Native PHP support, using php-cgi, if enabled in
      <a class="Xr" title="Xr">merecat.conf(5)</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The resulting footprint (~140 kiB) makes Merecat suitable for small and embedded
  systems.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
This program follows the usual UNIX command line syntax. Some options are,
  however, not available when <code class="Nm" title="Nm">merecat</code> is
  built with support for <span class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/merecat.conf</span>.
  The distributed archive comes with an example configuration file, which should
  be fairly straightforward to comprehend. For details on the available
  configuration directives, see <a class="Xr" title="Xr">merecat.conf(5)</a>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The options, in their entirety, are as follows:

      Otherwise the semantics of the

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CHROOT"><a class="permalink" href="#CHROOT">CHROOT</a></h1>
chroot() is a system call that restricts the program's view of the filesystem to
  the current directory and directories below it. It becomes impossible for
  remote users to access any file outside of the initial directory. The
  restriction is inherited by child processes, so CGI programs get it too. This
  is a very strong security measure, and is recommended. The only downside is
  that only root can call chroot(), so this means the program must be started as
  root. However, the last thing it does during initialization is to give up root
  access by becoming another user, so this is safe.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program can also be compile-time configured to always do a chroot(), without
  needing the -r flag.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that with some other web servers, such as NCSA httpd, setting up a
  directory tree for use with chroot() is complicated, involving creating a
  bunch of special directories and copying in various files. With merecat it's a
  lot easier, all you have to do is make sure any shells, utilities, and config
  files used by your CGI programs and scripts are available. If you have CGI
  disabled, or if you make a policy that all CGI programs must be written in a
  compiled language such as C and statically linked, then you probably don't
  have to do any setup at all.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, one thing you should do is tell syslogd about the chroot tree, so that
  merecat can still generate syslog messages. Check your system's syslogd man
  page for how to do this. In FreeBSD you would put something like this in
  <span class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/rc.conf</span>:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd">
<pre class="Li">

    syslogd_flags=&quot;-l /usr/local/www/data/dev/log&quot; 

</pre>
</div>
Substitute in your own chroot tree's pathname, of course. Don't worry about
  creating the log socket, syslogd wants to do that itself. (You may need to
  create the dev directory.) In Linux the flag is -a instead of -l, and there
  may be other differences.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CGI"><a class="permalink" href="#CGI">CGI</a></h1>
Merecat httpd supports the CGI 1.1 spec.,
  <a class="Lk" title="Lk" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875</a>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order for a CGI program to be allowed to run, its name must match the pattern
  specified either at compile time, on the command line, or in the config file.
  This is a simple shell-style filename pattern. Use * to match any string not
  including a slash, or ** to match any string including slashes, or ? to match
  any single character. Multiple patterns separated by | can also be used. The
  patterns get checked against the filename part of the incoming URL. Remember
  to quote any wildcard characters so that the shell doesn't mess with them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Restricting CGI programs to a single directory lets the site admin review them
  for security holes, and is strongly recommended. If there are individual users
  that you trust, you can enable their directories too using the pipe syntax,
  e.g. &quot;|/jef/**&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To disable CGI as a security measure, either disable the default
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">CGI_PATTERN</code> in
  <span class="Pa" title="Pa">merecat.h</span>, or set the configuration file
  option to the empty string, like this: <code class="Cm" title="Cm">cgi-pattern
  =</code> &#x201C;&#x201D;
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note: the current working directory when a CGI program gets run is the directory
  that the CGI program lives in. This isn't in the CGI 1.1 spec, but it's what
  most other HTTP servers do.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Relevant <span class="Pa" title="Pa">merecat.h</span> defines:
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">CGI_PATTERN, CGI_TIMELIMIT, CGI_NICE, CGI_PATH,
  CGI_LD_LIBRARY_PATH, CGIBINDIR</code>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BASIC_AUTHENTICATION"><a class="permalink" href="#BASIC_AUTHENTICATION">BASIC
  AUTHENTICATION</a></h1>
Basic authentication is available as an option at compile time. See the included
  configure script for details. When enabled, it uses a password file in the
  directory to be protected, called <span class="Pa" title="Pa">.htpasswd</span>
  by default. This file is formatted as the familiar colon-separated
  username/encrypted-password pair, records delimited by newlines. The utility
  program <a class="Xr" title="Xr">htpasswd(1)</a> is included to help create
  and modify <span class="Pa" title="Pa">.htpasswd</span> files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<code class="Nm" title="Nm">merecat</code> can use a global
  <span class="Pa" title="Pa">.htpasswd</span> file if started with the
  <code class="Fl" title="Fl">-g</code> switch, or you can rely on a per

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ACCESS_RESTRICTION"><a class="permalink" href="#ACCESS_RESTRICTION">ACCESS
  RESTRICTION</a></h1>
Access restriction is available as an option at compile time. If enabled, it
  uses an access file in the directory to be protected, called
  <span class="Pa" title="Pa">.htaccess</span> by default. This file consists of
  a rule and a host address or a network range per line. Valid rules are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#allow_from"><code class="Cm" title="Cm" id="allow_from">allow
    from</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The following host address or network range is allowed to access the
      requested directory and its files.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#deny_from"><code class="Cm" title="Cm" id="deny_from">deny
    from</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The following host address or network range is not allowed to access the
      requested directory and its files.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are three ways to specify a valid host address or network range:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#IPv4_host_address"><code class="Cm" title="Cm" id="IPv4_host_address">IPv4
    host address</code></a>,</dt>
  <dd>e.g. 10.2.3.4</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#IPv4_network_with_subnet_mask"><code class="Cm" title="Cm" id="IPv4_network_with_subnet_mask">IPv4
    network with subnet mask</code></a>,</dt>
  <dd>e.g. 10.0.0.0/255.255.0.0</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#IPv4_network_using_CIDR_notation"><code class="Cm" title="Cm" id="IPv4_network_using_CIDR_notation">IPv4
    network using CIDR notation</code></a>,</dt>
  <dd>e.g. 10.0.0.0/16</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<code class="Nm" title="Nm">merecat</code> can use a global
  <span class="Pa" title="Pa">.htaccess</span> file if started with the
  <code class="Fl" title="Fl">-g</code> switch, or you can rely on a per
  directory file which also protects subdirectories.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that rules are processed in the same order as they are listed in the access
  file and that the first rule which matches the client's address is applied
  (there is no order clause).
<div class="Pp"></div>
So if there is no allow from 0.0.0.0/0 at the end of the file the default action
  is to deny access.
<div class="Pp"></div>

  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">ACCESS_FILE</code>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THROTTLING"><a class="permalink" href="#THROTTLING">THROTTLING</a></h1>
The throttle file lets you set maximum byte rates on URLs or URL groups. You can
  optionally set a minimum rate too. The format of the throttle file is very
  simple. A # starts a comment, and the rest of the line is ignored. Blank lines
  are ignored. The rest of the lines should consist of a pattern, whitespace,
  and a number. The pattern is a simple shell-style filename pattern, using
  ?/**/*, or multiple such patterns separated by |.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The numbers in the file are byte rates, specified in units of bytes per second.
  For comparison, a v.90 modem gives about 5000 B/s depending on compression, a
  double-B-channel ISDN line about 12800 B/s, and a T1 line is about 150000 B/s.
  If you want to set a minimum rate as well, use number-number.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd">
<pre class="Li">
  # throttle file for www.acme.com 
 
  **              2000-100000  # limit total web usage to 2/3 of our T1, 
                               # but never go below 2000 B/s 
  **.jpg|**.gif   50000   # limit images to 1/3 of our T1 
  **.mpg          20000   # and movies to even less 
  jef/**          20000   # jef's pages are too popular
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Throttling is implemented by checking each incoming URL filename against all of
  the patterns in the throttle file. The server accumulates statistics on how
  much bandwidth each pattern has accounted for recently (via a rolling
  average). If a URL matches a pattern that has been exceeding its specified
  limit, then the data returned is actually slowed down, with pauses between
  each block. If that's not possible (e.g. for CGI programs) or if the bandwidth
  has gotten way larger than the limit, then the server returns a special code
  saying &#x201C;try again later&#x201D;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The minimum rates are implemented similarly. If too many people are trying to
  fetch something at the same time, throttling may slow down each connection so
  much that it's not really useable. Furthermore, all those slow connections
  clog up the server, using up file handles and connection slots. Setting a
  minimum rate says that past a certain point you should not even bother
  &#x2014; the server returns the &#x201C;try again later&#x201D; code and the
  connection is not even started.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is no provision for setting a maximum connections/second throttle, because
  throttling a request uses as much CPU as handling it, so there would be no
  point. There is also no provision for throttling the number of simultaneous
  connections on a per-URL basis. However you can control the overall number of
  connections for the whole server very simply, by setting the operating
  system's per-process file descriptor limit before starting merecat. Be sure to
  set the hard limit, not the soft limit.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MULTIHOMING"><a class="permalink" href="#MULTIHOMING">MULTIHOMING</a></h1>
Multihoming means using one machine to serve multiple hostnames. For instance,
  if you're an internet provider and you want to let all of your customers have
  customized web addresses, you might have www.joe.acme.com, www.jane.acme.com,
  and your own www.acme.com, all running on the same physical hardware. This
  feature is also known as virtual hosts. There are three steps to setting this
  up.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One, make DNS entries for all of the hostnames. The current way to do this,
  allowed by HTTP/1.1, is to use CNAME aliases, like so:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd">
<pre class="Li">
  www.acme.com IN A 192.100.66.1 
  www.joe.acme.com IN CNAME www.acme.com 
  www.jane.acme.com IN CNAME www.acme.com
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, this is incompatible with older HTTP/1.0 browsers. If you want to stay
  compatible, there is a different way - use A records instead, each with a
  different IP address, like so:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd">
<pre class="Li">
  www.acme.com IN A 192.100.66.1 
  www.joe.acme.com IN A 192.100.66.200 
  www.jane.acme.com IN A 192.100.66.201
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is bad because it uses extra IP addresses, a somewhat scarce resource. But
  if you want people with older browsers to be able to visit your sites, you
  still have to do it this way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Step two. If you're using the modern CNAME method of multihoming, then you can
  skip this step. Otherwise, using the older multiple-IP-address method you must
  set up IP aliases or multiple interfaces for the extra addresses. You can use
  ifconfig(8)'s alias command to tell the machine to answer to all of the
  different IP addresses. Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd">
<pre class="Li">
  ifconfig le0 www.acme.com 
  ifconfig le0 www.joe.acme.com alias 
  ifconfig le0 www.jane.acme.com alias
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your OS's version of ifconfig doesn't have an alias command, you're probably
  out of luck (but see
  <a class="Lk" title="Lk" href="http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/notes.html">http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/notes.html</a>
  for more info).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Third and last, you must set up merecat to handle the multiple hosts. The
  easiest way is with the <code class="Fl" title="Fl">-v</code> flag. This works
  with either CNAME multihosting or multiple-IP multihosting. What it does is
  send each incoming request to a subdirectory based on the hostname it's
  intended for. All you have to do in order to set things up is to create those
  subdirectories in the directory where merecat will run. With the example
  above, you'd do like so:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd">
<pre class="Li">
  mkdir www.acme.com www.joe.acme.com www.jane.acme.com
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're using old-style multiple-IP multihosting, you should also create
  symbolic links from the numeric addresses to the names, like so:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd">
<pre class="Li">
  ln -s www.acme.com 192.100.66.1 
  ln -s www.joe.acme.com 192.100.66.200 
  ln -s www.jane.acme.com 192.100.66.201
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This lets the older HTTP/1.0 browsers find the right subdirectory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is an optional alternate step three if you're using multiple-IP
  multihosting: run a separate merecat process for each hostname This gives you
  more flexibility, since you can run each of these processes in separate
  directories, with different throttle files, etc. Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd">
<pre class="Li">
  merecat -r         /usr/www      www.acme.com 
  merecat -r -u joe  /usr/www/joe  www.joe.acme.com 
  merecat -r -u jane /usr/www/jane www.jane.acme.com
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Remember, this multiple-process method does not work with CNAME multihosting
  &#x2014; for that, you must use a single merecat process with the
  <code class="Fl" title="Fl">-v</code> flag.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CUSTOM_ERRORS"><a class="permalink" href="#CUSTOM_ERRORS">CUSTOM
  ERRORS</a></h1>
merecat lets you define your own custom error pages for the various HTTP errors.
  There is a separate file for each error number, all stored in one special
  directory. The directory name is <span class="Pa" title="Pa">errors/</span>,
  at the top of the web directory tree. The error files should be named
  <span class="Pa" title="Pa">errNNN.html</span>, where NNN is the error number.
  So for example, to make a custom error page for the authentication failure
  error, which is number 401, you would put your HTML into the file
  <span class="Pa" title="Pa">errors/err401.html</span>. If no custom error file
  is found for a given error number, then the usual built-in error page is
  generated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In a virtual hosts setup you can also have different custom error pages for each
  host. In this case you put another <span class="Pa" title="Pa">errors/</span>
  directory in the top of that virtual host's web tree.
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">merecat</code> will look first in the virtual host
  errors directory, and then in the server-wide errors directory, and if neither
  of those has an appropriate error file then it will generate the built-in
  error.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NON_LOCAL_REFERERS"><a class="permalink" href="#NON_LOCAL_REFERERS">NON-LOCAL
  REFERERS</a></h1>
Sometimes another site on the net will embed your image files in their HTML
  files, which basically means they're stealing your bandwidth. You can prevent
  them from doing this by using non-local referer filtering. With this option,
  certain files can only be fetched via a local referer. The files have to be
  referenced by a local web page. If a web page on some other site references
  the files, that fetch will be blocked. There are three config file variables
  for this feature:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#url-pattern_="><code class="Cm" title="Cm" id="url-pattern_=">url-pattern
    =</code></a>
    &#x201C;<var class="Ar" title="Ar">**.jpg|**.gif|**.au|**.wav</var>&#x201D;</dt>
  <dd>A wildcard pattern for the URLs that should require a local referer. This
      is typically just image files, sound files, and so on. For example:
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    <div class="Bd">
    <pre class="Li">
  urlpat = &quot;**.jpg|**.gif|**.au|**.wav&quot;
    </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    For most sites, that one setting is all you need to enable referer
      filtering.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#check-referer_="><code class="Cm" title="Cm" id="check-referer_=">check-referer
    =</code></a> <var class="Ar" title="Ar">&lt;true</var> |
    <var class="Ar" title="Ar">false&gt;</var></dt>
  <dd>By default, requests with no referer at all, or a null referer, or a
      referer with no apparent hostname, are allowed. With this variable set,
      such requests are disallowed.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#local-pattern_="><code class="Cm" title="Cm" id="local-pattern_=">local-pattern
    =</code></a> &#x201C;<var class="Ar" title="Ar">PATTERN</var>&#x201D;</dt>
  <dd>A wildcard pattern that specifies the local host or hosts. This is used to
      determine if the host in the referer is local or not. If not specified it
      defaults to the actual local hostname.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYMLINKS"><a class="permalink" href="#SYMLINKS">SYMLINKS</a></h1>
<code class="Nm" title="Nm">merecat</code> is very picky about symbolic links.
  Before delivering any file, it first checks each element in the path to see if
  it is a symbolic link, and expands them all out to get the final actual
  filename.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Along the way it checks for things like links with &#x201C;..&#x201D; that go
  above the server's directory, and absolute symlinks (ones that start with a
  /). These are prohibited as security holes, so the server returns an error
  page for them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This means you cannot set up your web directory with a bunch of symlinks
  pointing to individual users' home web directories. Instead you do it the
  other way around &#x2014; the user web directories are real subdirectories of
  the main web directory, and in each user's home directory there is a symlink
  pointing to their actual web directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The CGI pattern is also affected &#x2014; it gets matched against the
  fully-expanded filename. So, if you have a single CGI directory but then put a
  symbolic link in it pointing somewhere else, that will not work. The CGI
  program will be treated as a regular file and returned to the client, instead
  of getting run. This could be confusing.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PERMISSIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#PERMISSIONS">PERMISSIONS</a></h1>
<code class="Nm" title="Nm">merecat</code> is also picky about file permissions.
  It wants data files (HTML, images) to be world readable. Readable by the group
  that the merecat process runs as is not enough &#x2014;
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">merecat</code> checks explicitly for the
  world-readable bit. This is so that no one ever gets surprised by a file
  that's not set world-readable and yet somehow is readable by the HTTP server
  and therefore the *whole* world.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The same logic applies to directories. As with the standard UNIX
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">ls</code> program,
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">merecat</code> will only let you look at the
  contents of a directory if its read bit is on; but as with data files, this
  must be the world-read bit, not just the group-read bit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<code class="Nm" title="Nm">merecat</code> also wants the execute bit to be
  *off* for data files. A file that is marked executable but doesn't match the
  CGI pattern might be a script or program that got accidentally left in the
  wrong directory. Allowing people to fetch the contents of the file might be a
  security breach, so this is prohibited. Of course if an executable file *does*
  match the CGI pattern, then it just gets run as a CGI.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In summary, data files should be mode 644 (rw-r--r--), directories should be 755
  (rwxr-xr-x) if you want to allow indexing and 711 (rwx--x--x) to disallow it,
  and CGI programs should be mode 755 (rwxr-xr-x) or 711 (rwx--x--x).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LOGS"><a class="permalink" href="#LOGS">LOGS</a></h1>
<code class="Nm" title="Nm">merecat</code> does all of its logging via
  <a class="Xr" title="Xr">syslog(3)</a>. All log messages are prepended with
  the program name, unless the command line option
  <code class="Fl" title="Fl">-I</code> <var class="Ar" title="Ar">IDENT</var>
  is used. The facility defaults to <var class="Ar" title="Ar">LOG_DAEMON</var>.
  Aside from error messages, there are only a few log entry types of interest,
  all fairly similar to CERN Common Log Format:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd">
<pre class="Li">
  Aug  6 15:40:34 acme merecat[583]: 165.113.207.103 - - &quot;GET /file&quot; 200 357

<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that <code class="Nm" title="Nm">merecat</code> does not translate numeric
  IP addresses into domain names. This is both to save time and as a minor
  security measure (the numeric address is harder to spoof).

If started in the foreground, <code class="Fl" title="Fl">-n</code>, and with

  <var class="Ar" title="Ar">debug</var>, logs will also be printed on stderr,
  unless the user also requested <code class="Fl" title="Fl">-s</code>. However,
  not all systems support the <var class="Ar" title="Ar">LOG_PERROR</var> option
  to <code class="Fn" title="Fn">openlog</code>().
